# ES. 9-1 & 9-2:
'''
 Make a class called Restaurant. The __init__() method for Restaurant should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type.
Make a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of information,
and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a message indicating that the restaurant is open.
Make an instance called restaurant from your class.
Print the two attributes individually, and then call both methods.
Create three different instances from the class, and call describe_restaurant() for each instance.
