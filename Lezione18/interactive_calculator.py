# An interactive calculator:
'''
It is required to develop an interactive calculator with at least 10 test cases using UnitTest (possibly) all execution paths!
User input is assumed to be a formula that consists of a number, an operator (at least and ),
and another number, separated by white space (e.g. ). Split user input using str.split(), and check whether the resulting is valid:+-1 + 1list
 If the input does not consist of 3 elements, raise a , which is a custom .FormulaErrorException
Try to convert the first and third inputs to a (like so: ). 
Catch any that occurs, and instead raise a .floatfloat_value = float(str_value)ValueErrorFormulaError
If the second input is not or , again raise a .'+''-'FormulaError
If the input is valid, perform the calculation and print out the result.
The user is then prompted to provide new input, and so on, until the user enters .quit

# Personalized math library: 
'''
Create a Python library that provides functions for handling fractions, with built-in error handling.
The library must include functions for the following operations:
Create a fraction from the numerator and denominator.

Collect the numerator and denominator of a fraction.

Simplify a fraction.

Add, subtract, multiply and divide fractions.

Check whether one fraction is equivalent to another.

All library functions must use the try-except block to handle potential errors,
such as null denominators, unsupported operations, or division by zero. 
The library must raise custom exceptions to indicate specific errors to the user.
